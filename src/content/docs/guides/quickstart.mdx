## 2. Prepare to Connect

### Set Up SSH Access

   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
   ```

2. Navigate to the **[Public Keys](https://cloud.medjed.ai/public-keys)** page in Medjed.ai
3. Upload your public SSH key (typically `~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub`)
4. Your SSH key is now configured for accessing instances

## 3. Launch Your First Instance

### Browse the Machine Market

1. From the navigation menu, select **Machine Market**
2. Filter machines by:
   - GPU type (NVIDIA A100, H100, etc.)
   - GPU count and memory
   - CPU cores and RAM
   - Price per hour

### Deploy an Instance

1. Click on a machine that meets your requirements
2. From the "System Disk cloned from" dropdown, select either a fresh system image or a previously detached disk in Detached State

## 4. Manage Your Resources

### Manage Instances

1. Navigate to **My Machines** to view all your instances
2. Available actions:
   - **Start/Stop**: Pause/resume instance (storage still incurs charges when stopped)
   - **Connect**: Access via SSH or Jupyter
   - **Edit**: Modify instance settings (limited to certain configurations)
   - **Delete**: Permanently remove instance and associated resources

### Manage Storage

1. Navigate to **My Storages** to view all your storage volumes
2. Available actions:
   - **Attach**: Connect storage to running instances
   - **Detach**: Disconnect storage from instances
   - **Release**: Permanently delete storage and stop charges

### Important Billing Notes

- **Instance Billing**: Charged per hour based on GPU type and resources
- **Storage Billing**: Charged per GB per hour regardless of instance state
- **Auto-stop**: Instances will automatically stop when your balance reaches zero
- **Resource Release**: Always release unused instances and storage to avoid unnecessary charges

## 5. Common Questions

### What is the minimum deposit amount?
The minimum deposit amount varies by payment method. Check the Billing section for current requirements.

### How do I avoid instance interruptions?
Enable auto-recharge in the Billing settings to automatically add funds when your balance falls below a threshold.

### Can I change the disk size after deployment?
No, disk size is permanent. Allocate more space than you think you need to avoid interruptions.

### What happens if my balance runs out?
Running instances will automatically stop. Storage will continue to accrue charges until released.
