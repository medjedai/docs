- **Data Analytics**: Process large datasets with GPU-accelerated frameworks
- **AI Content Creation**: Generate AI-powered content and graphics

## Getting Started

To get started with Medjed AI GPU VMs:

1. **Evaluate Requirements**: Determine the GPU type, memory, and resources needed for your workload
2. **Configure & Deploy**: Use the Medjed AI dashboard to provision your GPU VM
3. **Connect**: Access your VM via SSH and verify GPU availability with `nvidia-smi`
4. **Install Frameworks**: Set up your preferred AI frameworks (PyTorch, TensorFlow, etc.)

For detailed instructions, see our [QuickStart Guide](../guides/quickstart.mdx).

## Best Practices

### GPU Selection
- Match GPU model and memory to workload requirements
- Evaluate performance-to-cost ratio

### Cost Optimization
- Right-size instances to avoid over-provisioning
- Release unused VMs and storage to stop charges
- Monitor usage to optimize allocation

### Performance Optimization
- Use GPU-optimized frameworks and libraries
- Optimize batch sizes for efficient GPU memory usage
- Implement fast data loading techniques
- Consider distributed training for large models

### Security
- Use SSH keys for secure access
- Configure firewalls to restrict network access
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit
- Keep OS and applications updated

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

| Issue | Resolution |
|-------|------------|
| GPU Not Detected | Verify GPU drivers with `nvidia-smi` |
| Low GPU Utilization | Optimize workload and batch processing |
| Memory Errors | Reduce batch size or use a GPU with more memory |
| Network Issues | Check firewall and network settings |
