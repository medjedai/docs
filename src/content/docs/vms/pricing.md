Medjed AI GPU VMs use a transparent, pay-as-you-go pricing model with all prices displayed in real-time on the [Machine Market](https://cloud.medjed.ai/machine-market) page.

## Pricing Components

Your GPU VM cost includes two components:
- **GPU Cost**: Based on GPU model and quantity
- **Storage Cost**: Based on storage capacity

## Check Real-Time Prices

For the latest pricing, visit the [Machine Market](https://cloud.medjed.ai/machine-market) where you can:
- View current prices for all GPU models
- Filter by GPU type and specifications
- Compare prices across configurations
- Sort by price to find the best deal

## Important Pricing Notes

- **Billing Increments**: VMs are billed by the hour; partial hours round up
- **Storage Billing**: Charged per GB per hour, even when VMs are stopped
- **Automatic Shutdown**: Instances shut down when your balance reaches zero
- **Auto-Recharge**: Enable to avoid unexpected shutdowns

## Cost Optimization Tips

- Release unused storage volumes to stop storage charges
- Only provision the storage capacity you need
- Regularly check usage and adjust resources as needed
