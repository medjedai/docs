Medjed AI provides two primary storage options for your compute instances: **Disk** and **SharedFS**. This guide explains the features, use cases, and billing implications of each storage type.

## Storage Types

### Disk

Disk storage provides persistent block storage for your GPU instances. When you provision a GPU instance, you can attach a disk that persists independently of the instance state.

#### Disk States

Disks have two primary states:

1. **Attached State**
   - When the associated GPU instance is running
   - Storage is available for immediate use by the instance
   - Billed at the standard disk storage rate

2. **Detached State**
   - When the associated GPU instance is released
   - Storage remains persistent and retains all data
   - Continues to be billed at the standard disk storage rate
   - Content can be migrated to new GPU instances

#### Important Billing Note

- When you release a GPU instance, you have the option to release the associated disk simultaneously
- If you **do not** release the disk during instance release, the disk enters the detached state and **continues to incur charges**
- To stop disk charges, you must explicitly release the disk from the Storage Management page

#### Disk Benefits

- **Persistent Data**: All system configurations, installed software, and data are retained when the disk is detached
- **Fast Reattachment**: Quickly reattach existing disks to new GPU instances, eliminating setup time
- **Cost Efficiency**: Reuse existing disks with pre-configured environments instead of recreating them
- **Data Security**: Retain critical data independently of instance lifecycles

### SharedFS

SharedFS provides network-attached shared storage that can be accessed by multiple GPU instances simultaneously. This is ideal for collaborative workflows or when you need to share large datasets across instances.

<Aside type="caution">You must detach the SharedFS volume from all running GPU instances before it can be released.</Aside>

#### Key Features

- **Multi-instance Access**: Share data across multiple GPU instances
- **High Performance**: Optimized for large file transfers and parallel access
- **Scalable Capacity**: Adjust storage capacity based on your needs
- **Centralized Management**: Manage all shared storage from a single interface

## Storage Billing

| Storage Type | Billing Model | Notes |
|--------------|---------------|-------|
| Disk | Per GB per hour | Charged regardless of instance state (attached or detached) |
| SharedFS | Per GB per hour | Charged based on total provisioned capacity |

## Getting Started with Storage

### Provisioning Storage

1. **Disk Storage**: Automatically provisioned when you create a GPU instance
2. **SharedFS**: Provision separately from the Storage Management page

### Managing Storage

- **View Storage**: Access the Storage Management page to view all your disks and SharedFS volumes
- **Release Disk**: Select the disk and click "Release" to stop billing for detached disks
- **Attach Disk**: Select an existing disk when creating a new GPU instance

## Best Practices

- **Release Unused Disks**: Always release disks you no longer need to avoid unnecessary charges
- **Use SharedFS for Collaboration**: Share data across teams using SharedFS instead of duplicating data on multiple disks
- **Backup Critical Data**: Regularly backup important data from disks to external storage
- **Size Storage Appropriately**: Provision only the storage capacity you need to optimize costs

## Storage Limits

| Storage Type | Default Limit | Maximum Limit |
|--------------|---------------|---------------|
| Disks per User | 10 | 100 (with request) |
| SharedFS Volumes per User | 5 | 20 (with request) |
| Maximum Disk Size | 10TB | 100TB (with request) |
| Maximum SharedFS Size | 50TB | 500TB (with request) |

## Troubleshooting

### Cannot Attach Disk to Instance

- **Issue**: Error when attaching a disk to a new GPU instance
- **Possible Causes**:
  - Disk is already attached to another instance
  - Instance type does not support the disk size
  - Disk is in a failed state
- **Solution**: Verify the disk status and compatibility with your instance type

### Unexpected Storage Charges

- **Issue**: Charges for disks you thought were released
- **Possible Causes**:
  - Disk was not released when the GPU instance was released
  - Multiple disks are provisioned under your account
- **Solution**: Review the Storage Management page to identify and release unused disks
